Commentary
==========

As the Eternal Holy War of tabs-versus-spaces rages on, even within
individual projects, an emacs minor mode arises from the depths of
github with the goal of easing the burden placed on the programmer
of trying to maintain consistency in text files.

If you jump into a file that uses tabs for indentation, you shall
continue using tabs for indentation. If you jump into a file that
uses spaces for indentation, you shall continue using spaces for
indentation. That's the idea.

Installation
============

* Put indent-hints.el in your load path
* add the following line to your .emacs file:

    `(require 'indent-hints)`

* You can then activate indent-hints mode in a buffer the usual
way:

    `(indent-hints-mode)`

* You can also use the globalized minor mode to enable
indent-hints-mode in all buffers:

    `(indent-hints-global-mode)`

Use
===

Just check out your mode-line to see whether the buffer you're
visiting is space-loving or tab-loving. It also shows the ratio of
space-to-tab (or tab-to-space, whichever your buffer loves)
loving-ness that your current buffer exudes. Here's a "screenshot":

    `test.el Top -- (Emacs-Lisp Tab-loving:0.53 yas pair)--etc. etc.--`

The file being visited in the "screenshot" has more tabs than
spaces (53% of the lines that start with some sort of indentation
start with tabs, to be exact).

TODO
====

* Add some helper functions to switch between tabs/spaces profiles.
